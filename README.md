<i><b>A Docker Compose project to run on servers with spare CPU, disk, and bandwidth.</b><br/>Help the world by contributing your unused computing power to good causes.</i>

</div>

## Quickstart

1. Download [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/pirate/good-karma-kit/blob/main/docker-compose.yml) into an empty directory (or clone this repo)
2. Edit the `docker-compose.yml` file to fill in config vars, tune resource limits, or comment out containers you don't want to run
3. Start the containers with `docker-compose up`
4. Finish setting up some projects through their respective web dashboards exposed on localhost (see below)

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ArchiveBox/good-karma-kit/main/docker-compose.yml
# edit docker-compose.yml to fill in config, tune limits, or disable containers

mkdir -p data
docker-compose up
```

Next steps: Check the status of everything using `htop`
```bash
docker-compose ps
htop
```
Or use the web dashboards / leaderboards for each service listed below.

## Overview

Have some space computing power and want to donate it to a good cause? How about 10+ good causes at once?

> ‚ôªÔ∏è   put an under-utilized system to good use  
> üö≤  use as much or as little CPU/RAM/DISK as you want  
> ‚ú®  100% more soul warming than mining  
> üìà  geek out over your CPU/disk/bandwidth stats on the leaderboards

This is a collection of containers that all contribute to public-good projects:

- networks: Tor, i2p
- computing: boinc, foldingathome
- archiving: archivewarrior, zimfarm, kiwix, archivebox, pywb
- storage: ipfs, storj, transmission

This v1 list was started by the [ArchiveBox](https://archivebox.io) project, but it's open to contributions.

<small>We've added the 501(c)/non-profit status of each cause below, so you can filter out for-profit ones if you don't want to participate in those (e.g. Storj/IPFS/etc.).</small>

## Caveats

The nature of most of these containers is that you're contributing resources to the public or to specific causes running on the public internet.
Unless otherwise specified or restricted to 127.0.0.1 in the compose file, all ports should be made available to the public internet.
Make sure you understand the risks involved with exposing your machine to WAN. It may be worth running this in an isolated VM on an isolated subnet if it's on your home or corporate network.

Two optional containers need access to `/var/run/docker.sock`: `watchtower` (uses it to update the other containers), and `zimfarm` (uses it to fork worker containers for its sub-tasks). Make sure to update the containers yourself semi-regularly if you disable the `watchtower`.

Not all the containers are not-for-profit, some either reward you with cryptocurrency, or are affiliated with for-profit entities. Each container is marked below with its non-profit/for-profit status.

If there are too many containers for your liking, the top-3 high-impact and easy-to-run ones are:

- ‚≠êÔ∏è  `archivewarrior`
- ‚≠êÔ∏è  `boinc`
- ‚≠êÔ∏è  `tor`
